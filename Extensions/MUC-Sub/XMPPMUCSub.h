/**
 * The XMPPMUCSub provides support for a proprietary Multi User Chat extension of the
 * ejabberd XMPP server. This extension aims to provide a solution to the problem that 
 * users are required to send a presence to a MUC room in order to receive messages. By 
 * subscribing to the room a user can also participate if not online. Once reconnected,
 * missed messages are synced.
 * 
 * Users can, of course, also join the room as before. From the project specification:
 * 
 * "If a user wants to be present in the room, he just have to join the room as defined 
 * in XEP-0045. A subscriber MAY decide to join a conference (in the XEP-0045 sense). In 
 * this case a conference MUST behave as described in XEP-0045 7.2 Entering a Room. A 
 * conference MUST process events as described under XEP-0045 7.1 Order of Events except 
 * it MUST not send room history. When a subscriber is joined, a conference MUST stop 
 * sending subscription events and MUST switch to a regular groupchat protocol (as 
 * described in XEP-0045) until a subscriber leaves."
 * 
 * The extension leverages several existing XEPs to achieve its task. More details can be 
 * found on the project's website (as of 09.10.2017).
 * 
 * https://docs.ejabberd.im/developer/xmpp-clients-bots/proposed-extensions/muc-sub/
 * 
 * One note about subscriptions (taken from the ejabberd documentation):
 * Subscription is associated with a nick. It will implicitly register the nick. Server 
 * should otherwise make sure that subscription match the user registered nickname in 
 * that room. In order to change the nick and/or subscription nodes, the same request 
 * MUST be sent with a different nick or nodes information.
 *
 * This means that clients need to provide the nickname of the user in the MUC room
 * when subscribing. If none is given then the bare JID will be used.
 * 
 * MUC-Sub can be enabled by creating an instance of `XMPPMUCSub` and activating it on 
 * the `XMPPStream`.
